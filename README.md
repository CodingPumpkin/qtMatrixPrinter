# qtMatrixPrinter 
## Motivation
I made this little app to showcase my basic qt5 skills.
## Usage
You enter number of rows and number of cols for the matrix you wish to generate. After the "Generate!" button is pushed the matrix is generated and the output is printed out in the field below. The output consists of elements of the matrix printed out in spiral order. The matrix itself is generated with integer numbers in ascending order starting with 1.
